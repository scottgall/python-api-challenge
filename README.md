Answering the question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

## Description
This project contains two sections, [WeatherPy](WeatherPy) & [VacationPy](VacationPy). `WeatherPy` contains a `Jupyter Notebook` that uses randomly generated latitudes and longitudes to  get a list of over 600 cities from around the world using the [Citipy Library]('https://github.com/wingchen/citipy'). The script then makes calls to the [OpenWeatherMap API]('https://openweathermap.org/api) the get the current weather for each city, storying the data in a [Pandas]('https://pandas.pydata.org/) [DataFrame]('https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html')
